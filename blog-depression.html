          Feeling sad every now and then is common. In fact, everyone feels sad,
          as it&#39;s one of the 6 basic emotions of humans. But when feelings
          of sadness create an obvious and sustained physical and emotional
          change, it might be depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Major Depressive Disorder, or simply Depression, is a mental health
          disorder that&#39;s common and serious. In fact, about 264 million
          people all over the world suffer from depression. One in every 15
          people suffer from this medical condition at any given time, and about
          1 in every 6 people will have a depressive episode at one point in
          their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are many misconceptions when it comes to depression.
          People will often say they feel depressed when they lose their job,
          when they break up with their romantic partner, or when they lose a
          loved one through death. While feeling sad is completely normal - and
          even expected, when negative events occur in our lives, when the
          feeling of sadness becomes persistent and affects your daily routines,
          your work, or your relationships, then it becomes a problem worth
          seeking treatment for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depression is a medical illness described by feelings of sadness that
          last for more than two weeks, and represent changes in your level of
          functioning. It does not result from one single event, but can be
          caused by a myriad of issues. Some of these include genetics,
          environmental factors, staying in an abusive relationship, prolonged
          exposure to isolation, brain chemistry, and traumatic experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be difficult to tell if you or someone you know has depression,
          since being sad, feeling low, and not having the energy to do things
          can sometimes afflict anyone at any given time. To help you understand
          the signs of depression, here are some symptoms to watch out for:
          persistent feelings of sadness and low self- esteem, loss of interest
          in activities you previously enjoyed, changes in appetite, either
          eating too much or eating less (with physical changes in the body),
          not sleeping or sleeping too much, feeling exhausted without added
          physical activity, withdrawing from family and friends, the inability
          to take care of one&#39;s basic hygiene, missing out on work or
          school, and thoughts of death or suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
          While depression can occur at any age, the average onset of depression
          is from late teens to late 20s. Women are also more prone to
          depression than men. Some personalities are also more prone to
          depression, such as those that have low self-esteem or those that have
          melancholic personalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that depression can be managed and treated. With the
          right diagnosis, help, and treatment, individuals who are suffering
          from depression can move forward and enjoy a normal and fulling life.
          They can get back to their normal selves once again, enjoying
          long-term relationships, succeeding at their careers, and feeling joy
          and happiness.
