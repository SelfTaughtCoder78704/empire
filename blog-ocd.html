      <h1>Help for OCD</h1>
      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>
            OCD is a disorder that drives you to compulsively repeat thoughts and behaviors, which then causes
        significant negative consequences for your life. It can be hard to stop them when they take over, but
        with help from friends or family members who know about OCD it may become easier. Obsessive-
        compulsive disorder (OCD) forces people into repetitive rituals such as hand washing in order drive away
        unwanted thought processes like the fear of contamination by germs on one&#39;s hands. Constant
        repetition leads to time wasted performing these compulsive actions rather than focusing on work or
        other important tasks at hand; however, with support from relatives and close friends there are ways
        available on how to best deal efficiently with their condition before symptoms worsen any further.
        Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental illness that can make you feel like your thoughts are in
        control of you. OCD has no single cause, but it&#39;s often linked to genetics and brain biology/chemistry as
        well as environmental factors such as stress or trauma. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an
        anxiety related condition which causes people with the condition to have persistent unwanted thoughts
        called obsessions and carry out behaviors they find distressing called compulsions, just so everything
        feels &quot;right.&quot; The exact cause of OCD isn&#39;t known yet; however, research suggests certain genetic risks
        may be involved along with biological aspects including brain chemistry, function and structure.
        Environmental risk factors for developing this disorder include significant childhood events that were
        traumatic.
        </p>
       <p>
        You might think that OCD is just an adult mental illness but it in fact affects those as young as preteens.
        Boys are more likely to develop the disorder than girls and often experience symptoms at a younger age,
        too! Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you&#39;re a teen or young adult. But what
        many people don&#39;t know is that boys have higher rates of developing this problem then girls do; they
        also tend to show signs around 12 years old which leads us to believe males may be innately
        predisposed for obsessive compulsiveness. OCD can be hereditary, so if someone has a first-degree
        relative with OCD they are at higher risk. This is especially true for people who developed OCD as
        children or teenagers and have family members that also suffer from the condition. Researchers don&#39;t
        yet know what causes this difference in brain structure and functioning, but studies suggest it&#39;s possible
        trauma during childhood such as child abuse could play an important role in susceptibility to developing
        the disorder.

            The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. Your providers should
        perform an exam and ask you about your medical history that might be contributing to your symptoms.
        They will need to make sure a physical or general medical problem isn&#39;t the culprit, so they&#39;ll examine
        for any of those causes during the exam. Know that there is treatment available- Medications that can
        be prescribed slowly to help get rid of or minimize side effects. Keep in mind, the symptoms of
        obsessive-compulsive disorder are difficult to diagnose. It can be hard for doctors and therapists alike
        due to its similarity in presentation with anxiety disorders or because a patient may have both OCD and
        another mental illness at the same time; often, it is not until treatment fails that the sufferer will receive
        an accurate diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The treatments for OCD are diverse and varied. They can range from sessions with a therapist, to taking
        medication, or both--whatever suits the individual&#39;s needs best. The main treatments of Obsessive-
        Compulsive Disorder (OCD) include cognitive behavioral therapy which is done in session with either an
        addiction professional or psychiatrist; medicines such as antidepressants; physical exercise such as yoga,
        running on a treadmill at home; and journaling about experiences that usually cause anxiety like public
        speaking events. When writing your thoughts on paper it calms down your mind by organizing what you
        have been thinking all this time into structured sentences rather than leaving your thoughts scattered
        around without reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tackling this disorder can be difficult, but the first step is to seek professional help to guide you and
        support you on your journey to reclaim your life.
