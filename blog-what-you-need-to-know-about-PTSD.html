      <h1>What you need to know about PTSD</h1>

        <p>
          Everyone will experience some kind of stress throughout their life.
          When an emotional response to a stressful or horrific event impairs a
          person&#39;s ability to cope, it is often considered traumatic. While
          trauma does not always directly lead to
          <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/" target="_blank"
            >post-traumatic stress disorder</a
          >
          (PTSD), it is wise to understand some underlying behaviors so you can
          help manage/control PTSD. Studies have shown that PTSD affects 10% of
          women and 4% of men at some point in their lives. It can vary in
          severity, with one third experiencing the most severe symptoms
          including flashbacks, sleep problems and being easily startled.
        </p>
        <p>
          PTSD can affect anyone, and symptoms vary depending on the individual.
          This condition doesn&#39;t discriminate – it affects people of all
          ages regardless of their background or circumstances. The experience
          may be different for everyone who has PTSD, so paying attention to
          small details in behaviors can help. Symptoms appear differently, such
          as instantly after a traumatic event or even decades later with
          delayed onset where symptoms start to surface slowly as time goes on.
          There is no definitive answer to why some people who experience trauma
          develop PTSD and others do not. To understand this, we must consider a
          combination of elements that may contribute to the disorder or make
          individuals more susceptible to post-traumatic stress, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure to traumatic events</li>
          <li>Hormonal imbalances</li>
          <li>
            Front line occupation (Nurses, EMT, Military members, law
            enforcement)
          </li>
          <li>A family history of anxiety and depression</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many people associate PTSD with military members. However, one does
          not have to experience a specific event in order for them to develop
          PTSD. In fact, witnessing an accident can be enough of a
          <a
            href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma"
            target="_blank"
            >trauma</a
          >
          that it causes symptoms associated with PTSD (like intense physical
          reactions and emotions from painful memories). The same thing happens
          when children or teenagers face severe traumas which cause these sorts
          of behaviors. This is becoming even more common among younger
          populations than adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          PTSD is a disorder that can impact many people&#39;s lives. It has
          been estimated to affect around 10% of Americans at some point in
          their life, and while there are several symptoms associated with this
          condition, it often goes undiagnosed. Symptoms may include physical
          pain or discomfort - such as headaches, nausea, shortness of breath;
          insomnia/nightmares, or feeling constantly on guard for danger. When
          trying to determine if you or a loved one are living with PTSD, it’s
          important to remember that symptoms may not show up immediately. In
          fact, many people have reported experiencing symptoms of the disorder
          years after being exposed to trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking treatment for trauma as soon as possible is the most effective
          way to recover. Two of these treatments—medications and therapy—both
          have benefits on their own but are even better when combined together.
          Psychiatric help can take place in one-on-one meetings or group
          settings with your physician. Therapy helps many people suffering from
          PTSD feel relief by allowing them an open space to discuss whatever
          they need help understanding about what happened during a traumatic
          experience while also working through the memory itself. Talking can
          help people re-evaluate their memories, build skills for coping with
          trauma and feel supported. It is important to be able to discuss these
          difficult topics that are often brought up by talk therapy sessions in
          order to provide the necessary support a person needs after
          experiencing something traumatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to a patient receiving medication and/or therapy, it is
          helpful for family members to be involved. Family members should learn
          about PTSD so they can understand what their loved ones may be going
          through. They need to know that PTSD is treatable so that they can
          provide support by reaching out and staying positive in the face of
          adversity. Living with PTSD can be difficult, but there are many
          treatments that have been successful in helping people live healthier
          lives. Thankfully, here at Empire Psychiatry New York , we have the
          experiences to provide relief for your needs. We have created a system
