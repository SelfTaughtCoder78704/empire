        <p>
          Bipolar Disorder is one of the most well-known mental health
          disorders, often depicted in films and TV shows. But did you know that
          it&#39;s also one of the most misunderstood?
        </p>
        <p>
          Bipolar Disorder has often been the topic of movies, books, and TV
          shows because of the manic episodes individuals with bipolar disorders
          have. In these states, individuals can act overconfident, highly
          energetic, and can feel like they can do anything and everything.
          Oftentimes, however, they also engage in risky behaviors and act
          impulsive, such as buying a brand-new car, or gambling away tens of
          thousands of dollars, or getting sexually involved with strangers.
          These are behaviors that make for a great character on film or TV. But
          there is actually more to bipolar disorder than what you see or read
          in most books of fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bipolar Disorder is a brain disorder characterized by periods of highs
          and lows, with most people experiencing more lows than highs. Think of
          these highs and lows as opposite poles, this the name,
          &quot;bipolar.&quot; Those who suffer from this disorder can have
          periods where they are extremely happy and energetic, periods where
          they feel incredibly sad and low, and periods where they act normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no pattern to how and when these moods change, but there are
          three different kinds of bipolar disorders that vary depending on the
          severeness of their moods. These three types of bipolar disorders are
          Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothymic disorder, with the latter being
          the mildest form of the three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bipolar I Disorder is the most severe, with extreme episodes of mania
          and episodes of depression. They are also more likely to suffer from
          other mental health issues, such as anxiety, substance abuse, and
          ADHD. The risk for suicide is also significantly higher among those
          who suffer from Bipolar I Disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
          While mood changes can be normal in some people, those who have
          bipolar disorder suffer from significant disruptions to their lives.
          Their extreme behavior changes can make it difficult for them to hold
          a steady job, engage in long-term relationships, and daily routines
          can be challenging when they are in both their manic and depressive
          states. They may stay in bed for days and have feelings of
          worthlessness and dread, while during their manic periods, they can be
          extremely irritable, impulsive, with some even suffering from
          delusions and hallucinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is, with the right medications and treatments, bipolar
          disorder can be managed. Many adults who suffer from bipolar disorder
          lead successful and fulfilling lives.
        </p>
