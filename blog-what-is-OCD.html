      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>
          Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder that impacts 4
          million people in the United States. Although
          <a href="https://empirecareclinic.com/blog-ocd.html">OCD</a> can occur
          at any age, the average age of first appearance are between 8-12 years
          old and into the late teen/early adulthood. Obsessions are persistent
          images or thoughts that cause stressful emotions such as anger, grief,
          distaste, or shame. Some people with obsessive compulsive disorder
          know that their obsessions don&#39;t make sense, but they can&#39;t
          ignore or stop them. This is completely normal in this condition and
          if you’re suffering from these persistent thoughts, you’re not alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          When one experiences invasive and unwanted thoughts they can&#39;t
          control, it goes from the realm of being considered annoying to
          obsessive. Sometimes these thoughts won’t happen to often or will only
          be triggered in certain instances, but other times a person may have
          obsessive thoughts all the time and wish to get rid of them and feel
          free of their hold. To get rid of these feelings that come from the
          obsessions, people perform certain behaviors that follow rules or
          steps they make up for themselves; these are called compulsions.
          Compulsive behavior can also be referred to as ritualistic actions. An
          example is one who may obsess about germs so frequently that they wash
          their hands raw until the fear goes away after rinsing dozens of
          times.
        </p>
        <p>

          >
          hand washing is one of the most common compulsions tied to
          obsessive-compulsive disorder. Those with OCD can spend hours of their
          day washing and cleaning personal belongings or surfaces until their
          compulsion is met, and this also applies to the compulsion for
          achieving a feeling of cleanliness by repetitively showering multiple
          times per day. Some other examples of obsessive- compulsive disorder
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking the weather excessively</li>
          <li>Checking the oven if it’s on or off</li>
          <li>If the doors and windows has been locked</li>
          <li>
            Repeating a phrase, number, or word multiple times before they can
            relax
          </li>
          <li>Switching on and off lights in their house repeatedly</li>
          <li>
            Repeating something under their breath because of this fear that
            repeating it will prevent dangers from occurring
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The exact cause of OCD is still unknown, but researchers have found
          that it may be due to a lack in chemicals between nerve cells. One
          such chemical called
          <a
            href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/494236"
            target="_blank"
            >serotonin</a
          >
          helps prevent people from repeating behaviors over and over again. A
          person who has OCD often does not produce enough serotonin , causing
          them to repeat the same behavior repeatedly until it&#39;s completed
          successfully, or they break down into tears out of frustration.
          Symptoms usually begin during childhood or adolescence with around
          1/3rd affecting women more than men overall (though this statistic
          varies among age groups).
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot prevent OCD once you have it, the symptoms will always be
          there with you even if they become dormant at times. It&#39;s a
          chronic condition that needs to be managed by following your treatment
          plan and taking any prescribed medications as suggested even when you
          start to feel better. If you think that you may have OCD, it is
          important to see someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating
          mental health conditions. They will ask about your symptoms -
          behaviors, obsessions/compulsions which impact or interfere with
          day-to-day life. An accurate diagnosis of OCD requires an experienced
          professional, as this can sometimes be confused with other disorders.
