          <a href="/panic-attack.html">Panic Attacks</a> can be scary. Your
          heart pounds, you sweat, and your breathing feels like it’s cut off as
          these moments of terror take over with no warning or obvious trigger.
          You start to worry that the next attack might happen at any time
          without notice; what if one should strike while I am driving? What
          about when my child is playing in another room? For some people, the
          terror that accompanies a panic attack is debilitating. Left untreated
          and unchecked, this fear could lead to other fears or mental health
          disorders such as agoraphobia, which can in turn affect your quality
          of life by limiting social contact with others when they may be vital
          for your recovery process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word &quot;panic&quot; carries an innate sense of frightfulness
          because it&#39;s linked so closely to our fight-or- flight
          instinct--we&#39;re all hardwired from birth to know what we should do
          if faced with sudden deadly danger: either confront said threat head
          on (fight) or run away like hell (flight). But what happens after you
          find yourself paralyzed by a thought? A person with panic disorder
          will have sudden and repeated attacks of fear that lasts for several
          minutes or longer. These are called a &quot;panic attack.&quot; Panic
          attacks can be characterized by an intense feeling that something bad
          is about to happen, even when there is no real danger at hand. People
          who suffer from this illness often feel the need to escape in order to
          regain control over their feelings; however, they may not know how -
          as some people become so frightened during these bouts it becomes
          impossible for them think logically enough to run anywhere without
          risking injury. This results in many sufferers remaining trapped
          inside themselves until the episode subsides on its own within 10-15
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attacks will eventually dissipate on their own but sometimes the fear
          lingers long after an episode has ended - causing some people who
          suffer from anxiety disorders to experience debilitating symptoms
          every day including nausea, hot flashes, and dizziness, which are
          collectively known as “reactivity.” It can be hard to explain what a
          person with anxiety feels like when they are having an outright panic
          attack because everyone experiences different symptoms due to their
          own personal history of trauma or abuse. Panic attacks happen suddenly
          without warning - some people start crying out while others find
          themselves struggling for breath. Some participate in compulsive
          behaviors such as picking at skin on hands. The sudden fear that can
          overtake an individual can dramatically worsen the sensations of your
          body by making physical sensations feel even more sensitive than
          normal. This can also occur during periods where chronic stress levels
          reach maximum overloads causing constant feelings of dizziness,
          lightheadedness and other related side effects of anxiety, which may
          include nausea as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As sufferers know all too well, this highly debilitating condition
          doesn&#39;t just happen for no reason: it&#39;s likely that biological
          processes are at work here to varying degrees. The brain is a key
          player in fear and anxiety reactions; if certain parts of the brain or
          chemical balances aren&#39;t working correctly then there may be an
          opportunity for neurological changes during high-stress periods which
          result in these frightening symptoms, including palpitations and rapid
          heart rate, shortness of breath, and confusion. Researchers have
          theorized about what causes panic disorders - whether it’s genetic
          from a gene mutation inherited from one parent or family member, or
          environmental influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talk to your doctor about symptoms. Your doc will perform an exam and
          ask you about health history in order to rule out any physical factors
          that may be causing the attacks. If no diagnosis can be found after
          all other possibilities are eliminated based on examination, the
          patient will likely need follow-up with mental health specialists like
          psychiatrists or psychologists who specialize in diagnosing various
          psychological disorders from depression to anxiety disorder.
