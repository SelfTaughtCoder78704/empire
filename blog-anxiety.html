      <h1>Anxiety: How It Can Affect Your Life</h1>
      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>
          Anyone can experience anxiety every once in a while. It comes, then it
          goes. That&#39;s why many don&#39;t think of it as a big deal. People
          have come to accept that it&#39;s normal. But in some cases, anxiety
          sticks around longer than expected, and it can impact one&#39;s life
          severely.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#39;s more to anxiety than just being paranoid, worried, and
          nervous - even about the little things. Anxiety has symptoms and side
          effects that you should look out for.
        </p>
        <p>
          This disorder can occur at any point in your life. But before you seek
          any kind of treatment, you must first be sure about the problem. Is it
          really anxiety? How can you tell?
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it&#39;s considered common, anxiety can sometimes be difficult
          to identify. But there are physical symptoms that can help you confirm
          your suspicions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most alarming signs are sleeping problems like insomnia,
          and digestive issues, such as nausea and stomach pain. When you’re
          nervous, you might find your heart pounding hard and your body
          trembling with abnormal sweating. Common symptoms include the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Muscle tension</li>
          <li>Headaches</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s worth noting that there are different types of anxiety, like
          generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety, and phobias. Some
          of them have exclusive symptoms that are not mentioned above. These
          unique symptoms are associated with the person&#39;s specific fear or
          phobia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The symptoms may be a result of substance abuse, serious medical
          concerns, and traumatic life events. They can be triggered immediately
          or show up years later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anxiety disorders affect your physical and mental health. Many experts
          believe that anxiety forms in the amygdala, the part of the brain that
          is responsible for our emotional responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constant panic attacks cause our brains to regularly discharge stress
          hormones like adrenaline, which is supposed to be released only on
          high-stress occasions. But when you have it on a long-term and daily
          basis, your physical health can be in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your immune system will be weakened, putting you at risk of diseases
          and infections. The stress hormones can also lead to hyperventilation,
          which often makes one feel faint, dizzy, and weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anxiety can, overtime, lead to heart diseases - as it increases the
          possibility of blood flow interruptions. In other words, heart
          attacks. Even if you’re otherwise healthy without heart complications,
          anxiety can precipitate cardiac issues, if left untreated for a long
          duration of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cortisol, one type of stress hormone, shuts down the process of any
          system in the body that&#39;s not needed for immediate high-stress
          situations. One example is the digestive system. That&#39;s why
          different digestive disorders occur with anxiety, which often lead to
          loss of appetite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The physical effects can bring about another consequence - social
          issues. Anxiety can lead to depression, low self-esteem, isolation,
          hypersensitivity, and other negative factors to your social life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practice self-care. Eat well and sleep well. Keep your mind and body
          active. Avoid the things that trigger the symptoms. Reach out to

        </p>
        <p>
