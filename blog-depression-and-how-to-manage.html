      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, depression is not a state of being sad
          over one’s circumstances. It&#39;s different from feeling angry, sad,
          bored, or stuck at home with nowhere to go. Many close people around
          you, like friends and family don&#39;t understand that depression
          involves deep sadness in the absence of any reason for it. Depression
          is the mood disorder that causes feelings of sadness and loss of
          interests. It affects how you think, feel and how you behave. It has a
          way of trapping people. It can make you feel like you’re suffocating,
          making you feel like you can&#39;t live the life you want or interact
          with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day your world may be perfect - it could literally seem like
          nothing can go wrong; but on another day every little thing seems to
          fall apart or not work out, and no matter what you do, the feeling
          doesn&#39;t go away. Depression doesn’t discriminate against anyone
          based upon age, sex, or social status. It does not care about who you
          are as an individual because when one suffers from high levels of
          depression, they will know all too well what their self-worth becomes
          over time from constant feelings resulting from low level despair.
          Recognizing

            target="_blank"
            >depression&#39;s symptoms</a
          >
          is the first step to taking control of an unwanted behavior. Symptoms
          can vary between men, women, older adults, children, and teens so it
          may be challenging for some people to recognize them at times. Here
          are 5 common symptoms to be aware of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Difficulties paying attention, focusing on tasks at hand and making
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don&#39;t find any joy in your daily life or activities
            anymore, and it seems like everything is just &quot;blah&quot; to
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            A feeling of helplessness and hopelessness is when you feel like
            there&#39;s nothing to look forward to.
          </li>
          <li>Extreme changes in sleep patterns.</li>
          <li>Easily triggered, irritable and short tempered.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Ways to help manage depression</h4>
        <p>
          Sharing what&#39;s on your mind with a friend or loved one can be
          extremely helpful. When you talk about how you&#39;re feeling, it
          often feels like something really heavy has been lifted off of your
          chest and that the weight of it has decreased. Talking about
          <a
            href="https://www.mcleanhospital.org/essential/it-or-not-social-medias-affecting-your-mental-health"
            target="_blank"
            >mental health</a
          >
          matters, and it does have positive effects. While it may be seen as a
          call of help by some people and make them feel weak or shameful,
          revealing to a friend or loved one what you’re going through is
          perhaps the bravest thing you can do. Asking for support is an
          important first step to come out of disturbed state of mind that has
          been making you feel so vulnerable and alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&#39;s easier said than done but staying socially active can really
          make a difference. A depressed person will most likely feel more
          isolated and lonelier if they&#39;re not in contact with their
          friends. Social support is extremely important for overcoming negative
          feelings so it would be best to keep up your relationships, even when
          you don&#39;t necessarily feel like doing anything at all. Just having
          someone there who cares about what happens without judging you can
          make things better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression"
            target="_blank"
            >Exercise</a
          >
          can be a great way to manage your depression and can be as equally
          effective as taking medication for preventing future relapses. This
          has been shown in numerous studies with similar results. According to
          one study, individuals who exercise regularly are less likely than
          others who don&#39;t exercise at all of relapsing into depression,
          whether they choose medication or therapy treatment options. Studies
          have shown that walking for 20-30 minutes each day results in a
          significant influence on mild to moderate symptoms of depression. The
          act of walking, jogging, or running stimulates your brain and releases
          endorphins – a chemical reaction that provides the body a &quot;good
          mood&quot; signal, reducing pain and enhancing your mood. This, in
          turn, helps improve your headspace and makes you feel better!
        </p>
        Many people feel frustrated and are easily triggered at times, but if
        these emotions persist for a long period of time without any signs of
        going away it could be depression. Sadness is something everyone
        experiences from time to time too, however, when you&#39;re depressed
        it&#39;s different in nature since there are certain symptoms associated
        with having this mental illness. Those who are experiencing symptoms of
        depression shouldn&#39;t ignore it.
