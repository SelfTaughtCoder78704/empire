          For those who have experienced a traumatic event, it may be difficult
          to go about their daily life at first. It’s normal for sufferers of
          trauma to experience upsetting memories and sleep disturbances. Many
          people eventually get over these symptoms as time goes on - some take
          months or years before the effects are gone completely, but most do
          recover with time.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, others can still feel haunted by their past and experience
          symptoms that can greatly interfere with daily life. PTSD doesn&#39;t
          always show up immediately after an incident or stay in remission
          forever; sometimes anxiety attacks come back months or years later
          when one least expects them while at other times fear bubbles below
          the surface ready to resurface whenever triggered. This is simply due
          to our brains&#39; neurology in response to major traumatic events
          such as accidents causing bodily harm to oneself or merely witnessing
          a trauma happening to another individual. This includes the traumas
          that can occur during war.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&#39;re struggling with thoughts and feelings from the trauma
          for more than a few months, you may be showing symptoms of PTSD .
          Symptoms can include flashbacks to what happened during the traumatic
          event, nightmares about it happening again in your sleep, feeling like
          your always on edge or constantly waiting for something terrible to
          happen next - even if nothing bad has occurred recently. Some people
          also have trouble concentrating due to emotional energy spent living
          in fear every day that they may get hurt or killed at any moment. If
          these types of experiences are disrupting your life over an extended
          period, such as weeks or months, this could indicate post-traumatic
          stress disorder (PTSD).
        </p>
        <p>
          If one is exposed directly to trauma and/or injured during a traumatic
          incident, even if they were unharmed - they are more likely than
          others who were not in close proximity to develop these symptoms, and
          so it’s important to keep in mind when assessing their risk for PTSD
          development. It&#39;s essential that we don&#39;t stigmatize those
          with this condition, but rather learn how best to support them through
          whatever difficult journey might lie ahead once they have been
          diagnosed with such an issue so often found among veterans of war and
          other victims alike. PTSD does not discriminate. It can happen to any
          person, no matter how strong they are or what kind of life experience
          they have had up until that point. For example, if someone was
          directly exposed to trauma and injured during the event, there is a
          higher likelihood for them developing PTSD than somebody who
          wasn&#39;t involved at all but were still distressed and affected by
          the incident through TV news coverage.
        </p>
        <h3>Symptoms of PTSD</h3>
        <p>
          Memory- Individuals with PTSD have a hard time coping when they are
          reminded of their traumatic event. When the date comes around,
          flashbacks and nightmares may occur without warning. These memories
          can feel overwhelming to those who deal with them frequently or on a
          regular basis; but fortunately, there is help available for sufferers
          in need which can help to curb these painful reminders into manageable
          ones that won&#39;t keep you up at night any longer! People living
          with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often suffer from an
          inability to cope during periods of trauma triggered by certain
          events, thoughts about past occurrences, conversations associated with
          it, such as anniversaries etc., as well as feelings such as being
          overwhelmed - all symptoms stemming from repeated exposure through
          either internal stimuli or external triggers caused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Volatile Mood - The victim of a traumatic event is often bombarded
          with thoughts and feelings related to blame, estrangement, or
          difficult memories. The intensity can be so extreme that it becomes
          too much for the person to handle on their own. The aftermath of
          experiencing something horrific typically riddles an individual with
          negative emotions like shame, guilt and anger, and surprisingly even
          positive ones, such as excitement about what occurred - or the actions
          they took in order to survive. These strong reactions may intensify
          over time which can lead people who are currently coping by themselves
          to relive these events, in part because they may isolate themselves
          and do not have the support system around to anchor them and remind
          them how far away from that trauma they now are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neglect - Some people who experience trauma may turn to substance use
          as a coping mechanism. These individuals will often avoid friends and
          family, lose interest in hobbies they previously found pleasure from,
          or develop feelings of detachment and isolation with their loved ones
          that they did not experience before the incident took place. It is
          important if you have been impacted by traumatic events not only to
          find healthy ways to cope, but also explore new avenues which were
          unfamiliar to you prior to the event occurring, such as joining social
          groups where you feel more accepted, or taking up an activity like
          painting at your local art center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anxiety - Often, these symptoms may be signs of trauma. They could
          also come from an emotional event that&#39;s causing distress or
          anxiety in the person experiencing them, such as a big presentation
          coming up soon and are feeling stressed and anxious,for example.
          Often, when people experience extreme emotions like excessive anger;
          difficulty showing affection to others including friends and family
          members; having outbursts all the time etc., it can lead to medical
          problems, such as physical bodily reactions including increased blood
          pressure and heart rate (and these are just two symptoms among many).
          Getting professional help is often needed for emotions that feel out
          of control, because if left unchecked these symptoms may continue
          getting worse over time - both emotionally and physically.
