        <p>
          When someone says <a href="/schizophrenia.html">schizophrenia</a> what
          do you think? Do they know that it is a mental illness and not an
          uncommon disorder? In reality, people living with this disease are
          fighting the hardest battle of their lives to overcome its symptoms -
          which can be debilitating. Sadly, many have little or no idea about
          what life is actually like for those who live with these challenges
          day in and day out due to inaccurate depictions seen on TV or movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          One common misconception about schizophrenia is that it&#39;s a form
          of split personality. Split personalities, also called dissociative
          identity disorder
          <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"
            >( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual )</a
          >, are characterized by two or more distinct identities within one
          person; this isn&#39;t true for people with schizophrenia, who have
          persistent symptoms like hallucinations and delusions but don&#39;t
          experience any major changes to their sense of self. While some
          individuals may develop an alternate persona as a coping mechanism due
          to chronic trauma they&#39;ve experienced over time, such as abuse or
          neglect from caregivers, these separate identities usually disappear
          after the trigger has been removed and through therapy sessions and
          medications decrease their arousal levels. This is unlike those with
          schizotypal personality disorders which can manifest similarly yet are
          more consistent in their symptoms, without going away so quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schizophrenia is a mental illness that can be debilitating. According
          to the National Institute of Mental Health, people with schizophrenia
          require lifelong treatment. Early diagnosis and early treatment may
          help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop
          and can improve long-term outlooks. Schizophrenia encompass delusions,
          hallucinations or disorganized speech which reflects an impaired
          ability to function. These symptoms vary and may include any number of
          cognitive impairments as well as mood swings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schizophrenia is a complex brain disorder in which the afflicted
          individual has trouble thinking rationally with sound reasoning skills
          necessary for everyday life functioning such as work, school etc.
          Individuals with schizophrenia may likely suffer from depression due
          to their inability to manage emotions appropriately while also having
          difficulty understanding reality. They are often plagued by paranoia
          and believe others can hear what they think despite overt and
          objective evidence. This may cause great distress and these delusions
          will persist even if there is evidence to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is rare for someone to be diagnosed with schizophrenia after
          age 45, there have been instances of onset in later life. In one case
          study an 84-year-old woman was found slumped in her bathroom and
          unresponsive with her home flooding from a broken pipe. It turns out
          this elderly lady had reached high levels of psychosis which we now
          know as Schizophrenia at least 3 years before diagnosis, yet never
          showed any typical symptoms until then because they were masked by
          <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia"
            >dementia</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of
          worsening and remission (but some may always be present). Men
          typically start showing signs around their 20s while women often show
          them between the ages 30-40. For our youth, schizophrenia is a
          difficult condition to diagnose as it can mimic the symptoms of
          typical teenager behavior. The early signs are often mislabeled and
          misdiagnosed making appropriate therapy even more complicated for
          those suffering from schizophrenia when trying to get help or
          treatment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mental health struggles in teenagers with Schizophrenia have many
          similarities with adults however there are some key differences. Some
          common teenage behaviors such as not being able to concentrate during
          class, or struggling with socialization may be attributed instead to
          high levels of stress hormones than an actual disease state like
          schizophrenia, if they persist long enough without intervention by
          doctors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cure for schizophrenia is yet to be found, but there are a
          medications that can help prevent relapses. For starters, sticking
          with the treatment plan and getting assessed early on will reduce
          symptoms or decrease their severity of symptoms. Second, research
          suggests early assessment may lead to earlier diagnosis of this mental
          illness by linking risk factors such as family history of mental
          illnesses like psychosis or
          <a href="/bipolar.html">bipolar disorder</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sum it up, schizophrenia is a life-long and difficult condition to
          live with and requires a combination of medication, social support,
          and specific therapies. It cannot be cured, but it can be treated and
          managed so that an individual suffering with this condition can regain
          a baseline of function and find a measure of peace and happiness.
