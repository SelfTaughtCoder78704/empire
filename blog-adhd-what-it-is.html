      <h1>ADHD: What It Is And What Is Isn’t</h1>
      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>
          Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a brain-based disorder
          that has to do with the control of different sets of functions and
          behaviors. The brain operates as the main functioning skill which
          houses the abilities to understand, pay attention, provide emotions,
          retain memory, and concentration. There are various contributing
          factors that play a role in these challenges including chemical
          differences, structural difficulties, and genetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of today, around 11 million Americans have been diagnosed with
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html" target="_blank"
            >ADHD</a
          >. Since it&#39;s a neuro-behavioral condition that often lasts
          throughout someone’s lifetime without treatment, two thirds or more
          adults also still deal with the symptoms they had as children. ADHD is
          found in both men and women, but it has been under-diagnosed and
          over-represented among males. Research suggests that this may be due
          to the fact that boys are more likely than girls to demonstrate
          hyperactivity during testing or behavior at school when compared with
          females who show similar symptoms of ADHD. This means we cannot rely
          on a simple ratio between male vs female cases as there have not
          enough studies conducted which clearly identify if ADHD occurs more
          frequently in either sex. The input does not provide much context for
          how many people actually suffer from attention deficit/hyperactive
          disorder nor what factors contribute most towards an accurate
          diagnosis; however, research shows us the high rate of misdiagnosis
          involving adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagnosis of ADHD is outlined by the
          <a
            href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"
            target="_blank"
            >American Psychological Association</a
          >
          in the DSM-5. There are different subtypes, including combined type,
          which refers to symptoms from both categories (inattentive &amp;
          hyperactive) occurring together. But, not every case of ADHD is
          exactly alike since there are many differences due to their unique
          brain profiles as well as individual experiences. While some people
          may have only moderately impairing attention difficulties without
          significant problems such impulsivity within others, it will be much
          more severe when other factors like anxiety play into this disorder.

          People often use the term ADD and ADHD interchangeably. Although there
          is a difference between them, this current correct medical terminology
          for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder may be confusing to some.
          Since ADHD was first recorded in medical research (the late 1700’s),
          it has gone by many names. In fact, at one time people referred to
          ADHD as “
          <a
            href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-71799-9_256"
            target="_blank"
            >Minimal Brain Dysfunction</a
          >
          ” – thankfully times have changed! As the condition is better
          understood and researched, its name changes too; Many recall the term
          ADD and use this today out of familiarity. The most recent revision of
          the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual breaks Attention
          Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder down into three subtypes: Predominant
          Inattentive Presentation (ADHD-PIP), Predominant Hyperactive (ADHD
          PH), and Combined Presentation. Although using &quot;ADD&quot; may in
          some cases refer to ADHD with an Inattentive presentation more
          specifically, it&#39;s also just as often used a substitute for ADHD -
          which implies that if you don&#39;t specify on a case-by-case basis
          whether they have hyperactivity or not then their attention deficit
          will be assumed regardless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctors and Physicians used to believe that ADHD was related to head
          injuries and brain damage, but the reality is, most people with ADHD
          have no such history. They also thought food additives caused symptoms
          of the disorder because they aren&#39;t good for one&#39;s health in
          general, however there hasn&#39;t been any scientifically proven
          correlation between certain food or food additives causing this
          condition. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is caused
          by chemical differences in the brain, mostly as a result of genetics.
          Research shows that those with ADHD have abnormalities in how
          neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine work to facilitate
          communication between neurons and activate various functions within
          the brain.
        </p>

          There are a lot of factors to consider when seeking an ADHD diagnosis,
          so it’s important that you work with someone who is trained in this
          area. A skilled professional will conduct interviews and observations
          as well as comprehensive history-taking before making the final call
          on whether or not you have ADHD. Seeking out a psychiatrist
          specializing in ADHD and related challenges can help you get an
          accurate diagnosis for the disorder. Teachers, counselors,
          psychiatrists, or psychologists who are not specialized may have
          trouble recognizing symptoms of ADHD; therefore, it is best to seek
          one that specializes in this field.

          A primary care physician might be able to identify signs of ADHD, but
          they don&#39;t usually diagnose patients with psychiatric conditions
          such as ADD/ADHD because it requires extensive understanding about
          mental health issues thus often referring their patients to
          specialists. Thankfully, here at
